## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned quite a bit on how to make the website more responsive using the @media tag. As well as deal with flexboxes.

### Continued development

There are still quite a few areas where I would need to work on like flexboxes as I am not sure if segmented my areas properly. I also want to know how grid works so thats another part.
